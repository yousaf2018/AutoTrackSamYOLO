**AutoTrackSamYOLO** is a powerful, GUI-based desktop application designed to automate the detection, tracking, and analysis of **any moving object** in video footage.

Whether you are tracking microscopic living organisms, nano-scale particles, or complex biological systems in dense marine environments, this platform is purpose-built to handle extreme occlusion and crowded visual scenes. Traditional computer-vision pipelines struggle with overlapping targets, rapid motion, and scale variation, but this system eliminates the classic "Cold Start" problem. By combining Meta’s Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) with lightweight user interaction, it can rapidly generate precise labels and track targets without requiring thousands of manually drawn bounding boxes. This enables researchers to solve highly complex detection and tracking challenges in environments where conventional tools fail — from plankton-rich marine ecosystems to dense microbial cultures under the microscope.
****

Beyond serving as a smart tracker, the platform functions as a full **Dataset Factory**. It automatically converts trajectories and segmentations into training-ready **YOLO annotations**, allowing you to train custom detectors on your own data with minimal effort.

Once trained, your YOLO models can be deployed on **EthoGrid** a distributed, high-throughput analysis framework designed for large-scale, real-time inference workloads.  
You can navigate to EthoGrid here: **[EthoGrid on GitHub](https://github.com/yousaf2018/EthoGrid)**.

By pairing YOLO’s fast, real-time inference capabilities with EthoGrid’s scalable compute architecture, you can process massive volumes of video data in parallel achieving extremely high throughput suitable for laboratory automation, population-level animal behavior studies, continuous traffic monitoring, sports analytics, and any application requiring real-time, high-frame-rate processing.

This pipeline — **SAM 3 for rapid annotation → YOLO for optimized detection → EthoGrid for massive-scale inference** provides an end-to-end solution for high-throughput, production-ready computer-vision analysis.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Hybrid One-Shot Detection
**Eliminate the tedious task of manual labeling.**

- **Draw Once**: Simply draw a bounding box around one example target (e.g., one car, one cell, one person).
- **Find All**: The engine uses advanced template matching and visual similarity scanning to instantly locate all similar objects in the frame.
- **Track Everywhere**: SAM 3 propagates these masks through time with pixel-perfect precision, handling occlusions and complex movements.

### 2. Hardware-Optimized Performance
**Run state-of-the-art AI models on standard consumer hardware.**

- **Smart Chunking**: Automatically splits long videos into manageable segments (e.g., 5-10s) to prevent memory overflows.
- **VRAM Management**: Processes objects in batches (e.g., 16 targets at a time) to ensure smooth operation on 8GB-12GB GPUs.
- **Fast Mode**: Toggle video rendering off for 50-70% faster data extraction when visual overlays aren't needed.

### 3. Comprehensive Analytics
**Turn video into data immediately.**

- **Quantitative Data**: Exports detailed CSVs with Frame_ID, Object_ID, Centroid_X/Y, Size_Pixels, and Real_World_Size.
- **Visual Insights**: Auto-generates Density Heatmaps, Trajectory Plots, and Size Distribution Histograms for instant reporting.
- **Custom Calibration**: Input your specific scale (e.g., meters/pixel or µm/pixel) for accurate real-world measurements.

### 4. YOLO Dataset & Training Suite
- **Auto-Labeling**: Converts SAM 3 tracking histories into standard YOLO .txt annotations automatically.
- **Smart Split**: User-defined Train/Validation/Test split ratios.
- **Integrated Trainer**: A built-in GUI to fine-tune YOLOv8/v11 models on your newly created dataset—no coding required.

## 🔗 Integration with EthoGrid

AutoTrackSamYOLO is the official training companion for EthoGrid.

- While SAM 3 is incredible for initial annotation and zero-shot tracking, it is computationally heavy for real-time applications. For analyzing hours of footage efficiently, a lightweight detector like YOLO is preferred.
- Use AutoTrackSamYOLO to label a small subset of your videos and train a custom YOLO model.
- Load your trained .pt model into EthoGrid.
- Perform in-depth, real-time behavioral analysis (velocity profiling, zone preference, interaction metrics, turning angles) on massive datasets with high efficiency.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) recommended for SAM 3 & Training.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoTrackSamYOLO.git
cd AutoTrackSamYOLO
```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
or
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
3. **Link SAM 3:**
Download the SAM 3 / SAM 2 repository and checkpoints. You will point the app to this folder in the GUI configuration.
4. **Run the App:**
```bash
python main.py
```


## 📖 User Guide

### Step 1: Tracking & Analysis
1.  **Input:** Click **"Add File"** or **"Add Folder"** to load your videos.
2.  **Configure:** Set your **Pixel Scale** (e.g., 0.5 meters/pixel) and **Match Sensitivity** (0.60 is standard).
3.  **Template:** Click a video. Draw boxes around **representative targets** (e.g., "Vehicle Type A", "Subject B"). Click **Preview** to verify detection.
4.  **Run:** Click **Start Batch Analysis**.
5.  **Output:** The app generates a results folder containing the tracked video, CSV physics data, and visual plots.

### Step 2: Create YOLO Dataset
1.  Open the **Dataset Creator** from the launcher.
2.  Select your **Raw Videos** folder and the **SAM3 Results** folder (generated in Step 1).
3.  Define **Max Frames** to sample and your **Train/Val/Test** split percentages.
4.  Click **Generate**. The app extracts frames, normalizes bounding boxes, and organizes the folder structure for YOLO.

### Step 3: Train Model
1.  Open the **Model Trainer**.
2.  Select the `data.yaml` file generated in Step 2.
3.  Choose a base model (e.g., `yolov8n.pt` for speed, `yolov8x.pt` for accuracy).
4.  Click **Start Training**. You can monitor loss and mAP metrics directly in the GUI log.
